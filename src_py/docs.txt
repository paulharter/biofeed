class Biofeed

creation

- Biofeed()

Makes a biofeed object typically you will only need one of these
eg feed = biofeed.Biofeed()

methods

- addDsu(port, channels, serial=None, saveToFile=None)
    Adds a DSU to the feed
    port - is the com port number (zero indexed so com 40 is 39 might change this?)
    channels - is the number in channels on the dsu
    serial - ought not to be here really as only for testing ignore it
    saveToFile - Address of a file to save data to

- addChannel(name, port, ch, filters, size, combine)
    Adds a channel and returns a instance of biofeed.biofeedCollector.Channel
    name - is just a friendly name for your convienence.
    port - is the com port number as above
    ch - is an integer index of the channel on this port
    filters - is a list of filter names 
    size - is the number of samples that you want remembered in the history
    combine - if you want to sample at a lower rate how many samples you want combined
    
- start()
    Starts the feed.

- stop()
    Stops the feed.

class Channel

Channel are made for you by calling addChannel on an instance of Biofeed

methods 

- calibrate(offset, multiplier)
    By default the values recieved will be floats in the range 0-1024 (as used in P3)
    Use this method the scale the results to (value + offset) * multiplier
    
properties

- value
    gives you the average value since last time you asked or repeats the same value if no new input
    
- lastValue
    gives you the single last sample recieved
    
- history
    gives you a list of values and a fraction
    If you gave a value other than 1 for combine in addChannel the values in the list will be averages 
    of this number of samples and fraction will tell you how far through the latest set of combined samples you are

        
Example:

from biofeed.biofeed import Biofeed

COM_PORT = 39

feed = Biofeed()

feed.addDsu(COM_PORT, 8)
   
heart = bio.addChannel("heart", COM_PORT, 0, ["ecg"], 320, 4)
gsr = bio.addChannel("excite", COM_PORT, 1, ["gsr"], 320, 4)
frown = bio.addChannel("frown", COM_PORT, 2, ["emg"], 320, 4)
smile = bio.addChannel("smile", COM_PORT, 3, ["emg"], 320, 4)

#optional calibrations to normalise range of results
gsr.calibrate(0.0, 1.0)
smile.calibrate(0.0, 1.0)
frown.calibrate(0.0, 1.0)
heart.calibrate(0.0, 1.0)

feed.start()

# Then get data with calls like these

# A list of 320 values each the average of 4 samples
smileHistory, i = smile.history 

# The average value since last time you asked
gsrValue = gsr.value 

# The last sample recieved
lastFrown = frown.lastValue

#best to formally  stop it when you are done

feed.stop()
