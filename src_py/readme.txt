You will need:

Python 2.6
http://www.python.org/download/

pySerial (2.5 works with 2.6)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/files/

I like to use Eclipse with pyDev as an IDE

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
I use the classic package and then use the built in software updates to add pyDev
you have to add the pyDev update site yourself

call me if you have problems
